    1. Add coaches to DB in clockI and other table to make everything work
    2.Can I add the functionality of checking task you have already completed in the coach side?
    3.Remove comments from foreach loop in the pie chart section so it loops through all the coaches
    4.Remove comments on day variable in the view coach function in the controller
    4.It should log out of the user session when the window is closed. Do this using sessionStorage (might work, might not).
